The lectures are fast-paced, and he covers a lot of material, so staying on top of the readings is crucial. The problem sets are difficult, but they are great for solidifying concepts. Be prepared for a heavy workload, especially around midterms and finals."

The group projects are the most time-consuming part, but they are very well-organized and simulate actual software development environments. The lectures provide a solid foundation, but the real learning happens in the hands-on work."

His lectures are detailed, and he expects a lot from his students. The projects are challenging and require a strong understanding of SQL and database design. The workload is heavy, but the knowledge gained is invaluable."
